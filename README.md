Here is the description about my "Login Page".
It is designed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 
Once you run the code on the port you will be redirected to the browser and the webpage with login form will appear. 
In the form you can see two fields in which first one is for entering the email and the other one is for password.
Once you enter the detais correctly then you can submit those details by pressing the login button.
If the details are correct the success message will be displayed.
If the details are not correct then the error messages will be displayed.
Even when the details are correct and if there are other issues regading fetching data then a failure message will be displayed.
When you enter the password if it is not visible you can click on the eye icon that makes the password vissible and vice-versa.
When you check the Remember Me box it will store the email and password and when you get back to the page you can still see your email and password filled in the fields until you un-check the box.
